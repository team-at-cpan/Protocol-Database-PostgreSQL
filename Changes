    New features:

    - Protocol::Database::PostgreSQL::Error class for better abstraction and
    error handling
    - Proper COPY IN/OUT support (text protocol only for now)

    Cosmetic:

    - in debug mode, was generating a lot of unimportant output - have downgraded
    that to trace level instead.

1.000     2019-03-28 21:15:00+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur

    Forked from Protocol::PostgreSQL due to significant API changes.

Old Protocol::PostgreSQL version history:

0.008     2011-07-16 22:42:10 Europe/London
	Switch to Mixin::Event::Dispatch for event handling. Now uses ->invoke_event and
	->add_handler_for_event to deal with events, passing on_* callbacks to statement
	handles and db handles is still supported.
	Pass through the statement and portal when building a statement.
	Support ->discard on a statement handle
	Pass through ->debug value rather than setting true/false
	Wait for a startup event before processing queued requests
	Additional events:
	* command_complete now passed through when calling ->prepare_async
	* close_complete supported in statements, with pending queued handlers

0.007     2011-06-11 17:38:59 Europe/London
	Included some extra callbacks for statements so that we know when it's safe to send data, and provide
	support for the terminate/close requests so we disconnect cleanly.

0.006     2011-02-26 18:55:27 Europe/London
	More support for COPY IN, interleaved prepared statements and callbacks for data_row / no_data conditions.
	Improved performance slightly by moving some slow debug handling into coderefs.

0.005     2011-02-20 18:14:42 Europe/London
	Better handling of interleaved prepared statements (need to be named for this to work as expected).

	Finish send_copy_data implementation.

0.003     2011-02-20 02:28:32 Europe/London
